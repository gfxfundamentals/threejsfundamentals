Title: Three.js Debugging JavaScript
Description: How to debug JavaScript with THREE.js

Most of this article is not directly about THREE.js but is
rather about debugging JavaScript in general. It seemed important in
that many people just starting with THREE.js are also just
starting with JavaScript so I hope this can help them more easily
solve any issues they run into.

Debugging is a big topic and I probably can't begin to cover
everything there is to know but if you're new to JavaScript
then here's an attempt to give a few pointers. I strongly
suggest you take some time to learn them. They'll help you 
enormously in your learning.

## Learn your Browser's Developer Tools

All browsers have developer tools. 
[Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/),
[Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/son/docs/Tools), 
[Safari](https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/), 
[Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide).

In Chrome you can click the the `⋮` icon, pick More Tools->Developer Tools
to get to the developer tools. A keyboard shortcut is also shown there.

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-chrome.jpg" style="width: 789px;"></div>

In Firefox you click the `☰` icon, pick "Web Developer", then pick
"Toggle Tools"

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-firefox.jpg" style="width: 786px;"></div>

In Safari you first have to enable the Develop menu from the 
Advanced Safari Preferences.

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-enable-safari.jpg" style="width: 775px;"></div>

Then in the Develop menu you can pick "Show/Connect Web Inspector".

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-safari.jpg" style="width: 777px;"></div>

With Chrome you can also [use Chrome on your computer to debug webpages running on Chrome on your Android phone or tablet](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/).
Similarly with Safari you can 
[use your computer to debug webpages running on Safari on iPhones and iPads](https://www.google.com/search?q=safari+remote+debugging+ios).

I'm most familiar with Chrome so this guide will be using Chrome
as an example when refering to tools but most browsers have similar
features so it should be easy to apply anything here to all browsers.

## Turn off the cache

Browsers try to reuse data they've already downloaded. This is great
for users so if you visit a website a second time many of the files
used to display the site will not have be downloaded again.

On the other hand this can be bad for web development. You change
a file on your computer, reload the page, and you don't see the changes
because the browser uses the version it got last time.

One solution during web development is to turn off the cache. This
way the browser will always get the newest versions of your files.

First pick settings from the corner menu

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-chrome-settings.jpg" style="width: 778px"></div>

Then pick "Disable Cache (while DevTools is open)".

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-chrome-disable-cache.jpg" style="width: 779px"></div>

## Use the JavaScript console

Inside all devtools is a *console*. It shows warnings and error messages.

** READ THE MESSAGES!! **

Typically there should be only 1 or 2 messages.

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-no-errors.jpg" style="width: 779px"></div>

If you see any others **READ THEM**. For example:

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-errors.jpg" style="width: 779px"></div>

I mis-spelled "three" as "threee"

You can also print your own info to the console with with `console.log` as in

```js
console.log(someObject.position.x, someObject.position.y, someObject.position.z);
```

Even cooler, if you log an object you can inspect it. For example if we log
the root scene object from [the gLTF article](threejs-load-gltf.html)

```js
  {
    const gltfLoader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
    gltfLoader.load('resources/models/cartoon_lowpoly_small_city_free_pack/scene.gltf', (gltf) => {
      const root = gltf.scene;
      scene.add(root);
+      console.log(root);
```

Then we can expand that object in the JavaScript console

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/devtools-console-object.gif"></div>

You can also use `console.error` which reports the message in red
in includes a stack trace.

## Put data on screen

Another obvious but often overlooked way is to add `<div>` or `<pre>` tags
and put data in them.

The most obvious way is to make some HTML elements

```html
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
+<div id="debug">
+  <div>x:<span id="x"></span></div>
+  <div>y:<span id="y"></span></div>
+  <div>z:<span id="z"></span></div>
+</div>
```

Style them so they stay on top of the canvas. (assuming your canvas
fills the page)

```html
<style>
#debug {
  position: absolute;
  left: 1em;
  top: 1em;
  padding: 1em;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
  color: white;
  font-family: monospace;
}
</style>
```

And then looking the elements up and setting their content.

```js
// at init time
const xElem = document.querySelector('#x');
const yElem = document.querySelector('#y');
const zElem = document.querySelector('#z');

// at render or update time
xElem.textContent = someObject.position.x.toFixed(3);
yElem.textContent = someObject.position.y.toFixed(3);
zElem.textContent = someObject.position.z.toFixed(3);
```

This is more useful for real time values

{{{example url="../threejs-debug-js-html-elements.html" }}}

Another way to put data on the screen is to make a clearing logger.
I just made that term up but lots of games I've worked on have used this solution. The idea
is you have a buffer that displays messages for only one frame.
Any part of your code that wants to display data calls some function
to add data to that buffer every frame. This is much less work
than making an element per piece of data above.

For example let's change the HTML from above to just this

```html
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
<div id="debug">
  <pre></pre>
</div>
```

And let's make simple class to manage this *clear back buffer*.

```js
class ClearingLogger {
  constructor(elem) {
    this.elem = elem;
    this.lines = [];
  }
  log(...args) {
    this.lines.push([...args].join(' '));
  }
  render() {
    this.elem.textContent = this.lines.join('\n');
    this.lines = [];
  }
}
```

Then let's make a simple example that every time we click the mouse makes a mesh
that moves in a random direction for 2 seconds. We'll start with one of the
examples from the article on [making things responsive](threejs-responsive.html)

Here's the code that adds a new `Mesh` every time we click the mouse

```js
const geometry = new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 'red'});

const things = [];

function rand(min, max) {
  if (max === undefined) {
    max = min;
    min = 0;
  }
  return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}

function createThing() {
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(mesh);
  things.push({
    mesh,
    timer: 2,
    velocity: new THREE.Vector3(rand(-5, 5), rand(-5, 5), rand(-5, 5)),
  });
}

canvas.addEventListener('click', createThing);
```

And here's the code that moves the meshes we created, logs them,
and removes them when their timer has run out

```js
const logger = new ClearingLogger(document.querySelector('#debug pre'));

let then = 0;
function render(now) {
  now *= 0.001;  // convert to seconds
  const deltaTime = now - then;
  then = now;

  ...

  logger.log('fps:', (1 / deltaTime).toFixed(1));
  logger.log('num things:', things.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < things.length;) {
    const thing = things[i];
    const mesh = thing.mesh;
    const pos = mesh.position;
    logger.log(
        'timer:', thing.timer.toFixed(3), 
        'pos:', pos.x.toFixed(3), pos.y.toFixed(3), pos.z.toFixed(3));
    thing.timer -= deltaTime;
    if (thing.timer <= 0) {
      // remove this thing. Note we don't advance `i`
      things.splice(i, 1);
      scene.remove(mesh);
    } else {
      mesh.position.addScaledVector(thing.velocity, deltaTime);
      ++i;
    }
  }

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
  logger.render();

  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}
```

Now click the mouse a bunch in the example below

{{{example url="../threejs-debug-js-clearing-logger.html" }}}

## Query Parameters

Another thing to remember is that webpages can have data passed
into them either via query parameters or the anchor, sometimes called
the search and the hash.

    https://domain/path/?query#anchor

You can use this to make features optional or pass in parameters.

For example let's take the previous example and make it so
the debug stuff only shows up if we put `?debug=true` in the URL.

First we need some code to parse the query string

```js
/**
  * Returns the query parameters as a key/value object. 
  * Example: If the query parameters are
  *
  *    abc=123&def=456&name=gman
  *
  * Then `getQuery()` will return an object like
  *
  *    {
  *      abc: '123',
  *      def: '456',
  *      name: 'gman',
  *    }
  */
function getQuery() {
  const params = {};
  const q = (window.location.search || '').substring(1);
  q.split('&').forEach((pair) => {
    const keyValue = pair.split('=').map(decodeURIComponent);
    params[keyValue[0]] = keyValue[1];
  });
  return params;
}
```

Then we might make the debug element not show by default

```html
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
+<div id="debug" style="display: none;">
  <pre></pre>
</div>
```

Then in the code we read the params and choose to un-hide the
debug info if and only if `?debug=true` is passed in

```js
const query = getQuery();
const debug = query.debug === 'true';
const logger = debug
   ? new ClearingLogger(document.querySelector('#debug pre'))
   : new DummyLogger();
if (debug) {
  document.querySelector('#debug').style.display = '';
}
```

We also made a `DummyLogger` that does nothing and chose to use it if `?debug=true` has not been passed in.

```js
class DummyLogger {
  log() {}
  render() {}
}
```

You can see if we use this url:

<a target="_blank" href="../threejs-debug-js-params.html">threejs-debug-js-params.html</a>

there is no debug info but if we use this url:

<a target="_blank" href="../threejs-debug-js-params.html?debug=true">threejs-debug-js-params.html?debug=true</a>

there is debug info.

Multiple paramters can be passed in by separating with '&' as in `somepage.html?someparam=somevalue&someotherparam=someothervalue`. 
Using parameters like this we can pass in all kinds of options. Maybe `speed=0.01` to slow down our app for making it easier to understand something or `showHelpers=true` for whether or not to add helpers
that show the lights, shadow, or camera frustum seen in other lessons.

## Learn to use the Debugger

Every browser has a debugger where you can pause your program
step through line by line and inspect all the variables.

Teaching you how to use a debugger is too big a topic for this
article but here's a few links

* [Get Started with Debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/)
* [Debugging in Chrome](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)

## Check for `NaN` in the debugger or elsewhere

`NaN` is short for Not A Number. It's what JavaScript will assign
as a value when you do something that doesn't make sense mathwise.

As a simple example

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/nan-banana.png" style="width: 180px;"></div>

Often when I'm making something and nothing appears on the screen
I'll check some values and if I see `NaN` I will instantly have a 
place to start looking.

As an example when I first started making the path for the
[article about loading gLTF files](threejs-load-gltf.html) I made
a curve using the `SplineCurve` class which makes a 2D curve.

I then used that curve to move the cars like this

```js
curve.getPointAt(zeroToOnePointOnCurve, car.position);
```

Internally `curve.getPointAt` calls the `set` function
on the object passed as the second argument. In this case that
second argument is `car.position` which is a `Vector3`. `Vector3`'s
`set` function requires 3 arguments, x, y, and z but `SplineCurve` is a 2D curve
and so it calls `car.position.set` with just x and y.

The result is that `car.position.set` sets x to x, y to y, and z to `undefined`.

A quick glance in the debugger looking at the car's `matrixWorld`
showed a bunch of `NaN` values.

<div class="threejs_center"><img class="border" src="resources/images/debugging-nan.gif" style="width: 476px;"></div>

Seeing the matrix had `NaN`s in it suggested something like `position`,
`rotation`, `scale` or some other function that affects that matrix had bad
data. Working backward from their it was easy to track down the issue.

In top of `NaN` there's also `Infinity` which is a similar sign there
is a math bug somewhere.

## Look In the Code!

THREE.js is Open Source. Don't be afraid to look inside the code!
You can look inside on [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).
You can also look inside by stepping into functions in the debugger.
When you do that consider using `three.js` instead of the more common
`three.min.js`. `three.min.js` is the minified, compressed, and therefore
smaller to download version. `three.js` is the larger but easier to
debug version. I often switch my code to use `three.js` to step through
the code and see what is going on.

## Put `requestAnimationFrame` at bottom of your render function.

I see this pattern often

```js
function render() {
   requestAnimationFrame(render);

   // -- do stuff --

   renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
requestAnimationFrame(render);
```

I'd suggest that putting the call to `requestAnimationFrame` at
the bottom as in

```js
function render() {
   // -- do stuff --

   renderer.render(scene, camera);

   requestAnimationFrame(render);
}
requestAnimationFrame(render);
```

The biggest reason is it means your code will stop if you have an error. Putting
`requestAnimationFrame` at the top means your code will keep running even if you
have an error since you already requested another frame. IMO it's better to find
those errors than to ignore them. They could easily be the reason something is
not appearing as you expect it to but unless your code stops you might not even
notice.

## Check your units!

This basically means knowing for example when to use degrees vs
when to use radians. It's unfortunate that THREE.js does not
consistently use the same units everywhere. Off the top of my head
the camera's field of view is in degrees. All other angles are in
radians.

The other place to look out is your world unit size. Until
recently 3D apps could choose any unit size they wanted. One app might choose
1 unit = 1cm. Another might choose 1 unit = 1 foot. It's actually still
true that you can chose any units you want for certain applications.
That said, THREE.js assumes 1 unit = 1 meter. This is important for
things like physically based rendering which uses meters to compute
lighting effects. It's also important for AR and VR which need to
deal with real world units like where your phone is or where the VR
controllers are.

## Making a *Minimal, Complete, Verifiable, Example* for Stack Overflow

If you decide to ask a question about THREE.js it's almost always
required for you to provide an MCVE which stands for Minimal, Complete,
Verifiable, Example.

The **Minimal** part is important. Let's say you where having an issue with the
path movement in the last example of the [loading a gLTF
article](threejs-load-gltf.html). That example has many parts. Listing them out
it has

1. A bunch of HTML
2. Some CSS
3. Lights
4. Shadows
5. DAT.gui code to manipulate shadows
6. Code to load a .GLTF file
7. Code to resize the canvas.
8. Code to move the cars along paths

That's pretty huge. If your question is only about the path following part you
can remove most of the HTML as you only need a `<canvas>` and a `<script>` tag
for THREE.js. You can remove the CSS and the resizing code. You can remove .GLTF
code because you only care about the path. You can remove the lights and the
shadows by using a `MeshBasicMaterial`. You can certainly remove the DAT.gui
code. The code makes a ground plane with a texture. It would be easier to use a
`GridHelper`. Finally if our question is about moving things on a path we could
just use cubes on the path instead of loaded car models.

Here's a more minimal example taking all the above into account. It
shrunk from 271 lines to 135. We might consider shrinking it even
more by simplifying our path. Maybe a path with 3 or 4 points would
work just as well as our path with 21 points.

{{{example url="../threejs-debugging-mcve.html" }}}

I kept the `OrbitController` just because it's useful for others
to move the camera and figure out what's going on but depending
on your issue you might be able to remove that as well.

The best thing about making an MCVE is we'll often solve our own
problem. The process of removing everything that's not needed and
making the smallest example we can that reproduces the issue more
often than not leads us to our bug.

On top of that it's respectful of all the people's time who you are
asking to look at your code on Stack Overflow. By making the minimal
example you make it much easier for them to help you. You'll also
learn in the process.

Also important, when you go to Stack Overflow to post your question **put your
code [in a snippet](https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/09/16/introducing-runnable-javascript-css-and-html-code-snippets/).**
Of course you are welcome to use JSFiddle or Codepen or similar site to test out
your MCVE but once you actually get to posting your question on Stack Overflow
you're required to put the code to reproduce your issue **in the question itself**. 
By making a snippet you satisfy that requirement.

Follow these suggestions and your far more likely to get help
with your issue.

## Use a `MeshBasicMaterial`

Because the `MeshBasicMaterial` uses no lights this is one way to 
remove reasons something might not be showing up. If your objects
show up using `MeshBasicMaterial` but not with whatever materials
you were using then you know the issue is likely with the materials
or the lights and not some other part of the code.

## Check your `near` and `far` settings for your camera

A `PerspectiveCamera` has `near` and `far` settings which are covered in the
[article on cameras](threejs-cameras.html). Make sure they are set to fit the
space that contains your objects. Maybe even just **temporarily** set them to
something large like `near` = 0.001 and `far` = 1000000. You will likely run
into depth resolution issues but you'll at least be able to see your objects
provided they are in front of the camera.

## Check your scene is in front of the camera

Sometimes things don't appear because they are not in front of the camera. If
your camera is not controllable try adding camera control like the
`OrbitController` so you can look around and find your scene. Or, try framing
the scene using code which is covered in [this article](threejs-load-obj.html).
That code finds the size of part of the scene and then moves the camera and
adjusts the `near` and `far` settings to make it visible. You can then look in
the debugger or add some `console.log` messages to print the size and center of
the scene.

## Put something in front of the camera

This is just another way of saying if all else fails start with
something that works and then slowly add stuff back in. If you get
a screen with nothing on it then try putting something directly in
front of the camera. Make a sphere or box, give it a simple material
like the `MeshBasicMaterial` and make sure you can get that on the screen.
Then start adding things back a little at time and testing. Eventually
you'll either reproduce your bug or you'll find it on the way.

These were a few tips for debugging JavaScript. Let's also go
over [some tips for debugging GLSL](threejs-debugging-glsl.html).
