      <h1>Beautiful Cubes</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Cubes are beautiful</b>. You can have an entire planet of them, for instance.
      </p><p>
        How cool is that? (A bit confusing, honestly. I have always felt as though cubes had a tendency to be a little too cool and overly realistic. Like an endless collection of super-realistic robots… But I guess it is part of what makes them so interesting.)
      </p><p>        
        So maybe there's a limit to what the human imagination can do for me.
      </p><p>
        That can't hurt.
      </p><p>
        Well then… let's break it down.
      </p><p>
        Stardust
      </p><p>
        I know a lot of you are saying: You can't, because you will get stuck with something that's "too realistic." Well, I have a very real suggestion: Just don't be that dude. In fact, let's be very specific: If you have to do something, let the actual thing change. If it's a little weird to have a space ship, or a spaceship you have to fly, or … well, you probably already are.
      </p><p>
        Forget about all of the sci-fi stuff. Space. No sense hiding that from me.
      </p><p>
        The space in my own home was never real-world. It was never something that a person might have done. It was something that only seemed plausible to me. There was only one "space craft," and if you could figure        
      </p><p>
        <b>Cubes are beautiful</b>. Don't underestimate a nice stack of cubes.
      </p><p>
        If you decide to stack more than one cube, don't forget to use a stack of cubes as a guide to follow to make a tight fit. If a bunch of cubes are stacked too close together, the edges will stick out which will make for a tight fit!
      </p><p>
          Once again, if you decide you don't want to stack your boxes you can place another stack of cubes along the edge.
      </p><p>
        And you are done! The process is super simple and simple it's the easy stuff to set up.
      </p><p>
        But what if you don't like the size of the boxes?
      </p><p>
        You see, in the old days, a box was a solid block of wood, plastic or ceramic with an outer layer of cardboard.
      </p><p>
        In the 1990s, wood became the new material and in this method, the cardboard and wood are joined together so that they can both become a floor.
      </p><p>      
        But some people don't like to use just the plastic/carpet layer. And with those people, these cubes are more likely to get wet.
      </p><p>
        So how does this stack?
