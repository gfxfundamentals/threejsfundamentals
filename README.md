Three.js Fundamentals
=====================

This is [a series of lessons or tutorials about three.js](http://threejsfundamentals.org/).

This is work in progress. Feel free to contribute, especially localizations

## Contributing

Of course bug fixes are always welcome.

If you'd like to write a new article please try to always take
one step at a time. Don't do 2 or more things in a single step.
Explain any new math in the simplest terms possible. Ideally
with diagrams where possible. Also it's probably best to
ask to make sure someone else isn't already working on a similar
article.

## Article notes

A code word in a paragraph, as in

```md
A `BoxBufferGeometry` makes a box.
```

Will get automatically turned into a link to the THREE.js docs
if the word happens to be one of the names in the three.js library.
Similarly adding a `.property` as in

```md
Use `Material.opacity` to set the opacity level.
```

Will get turned into a link to the three.js `Material` docs
with an hash to `opacity`.

The link itself will also be checked similarly so for example

```md
We can set the color by hsl using [material.setHSL(hue, saturation, level)](MeshBasicMaterial.setHSL) and
passing in values from 0 to 1 for each of `hue`, `saturation` and `level`.
```

The `[stuff](Material.setHSL)` will get turned into a link to the docs

Currently this happens in the browser, not at build time.

### Translating

Each translation goes in a folder under `threejs/lessons/<country-code>`.

Required files are

    langinfo.hanson
    index.md
    toc.html
    lang.css (optional)

#### `langinfo.hanson`

Defines various language specific options.
[Hanson](https://github.com/timjansen/hanson) is a JSON like format but allows comments.

Current fields are

    {
      // The language (will show up in the language selection menu)
      language: 'English',

      // Phrase that appears under examples
      defaultExampleCaption: "click here to open in a separate window",

      // Title that appears on each page
      title: 'Three Fundamentals',

      // Basic description that appears on each page
      description: 'Learn Three.js',

      // Link to the language root.
      link: 'http://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/ja',  // replace `ja` with country code

      // html that appears after the article and before the comments
      commentSectionHeader: '<div>Questions? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js">Ask on stackoverflow</a>.</div>\n        <div>Issue/Bug? <a href="http://github.com/greggman/threefundamentals/issues">Create an issue on github</a>.</div>',

      // markdown that appears for untranslated articles
      missing: "Sorry this article has not been translated yet. [Translations Welcome](https://github.com/gfxfundamentals/threejsfundamentals)! ðŸ˜„\n\n[Here's the original English article for now]({{{origLink}}}).",

      // the phrase "Table of Contents"
      toc: "Table of Contents",

      // translation of categories
      categoryMapping: {
        'basics': 'Basics',
        'solutions:' 'Solutions',
        'webvr': 'WebVR',
        'optimization': 'Optimization',
        'tips': 'Tips',
        'fundamentals': 'Fundamentals',
        'reference': 'Reference',
      },

    }

#### `index.md`

This is the template for the main page for each language

#### `toc.html`

This is template for the table of contents for the language.
It is included on both the index and on each article. The only
parts not auto-generated are the links ending links which
you can translate if you want to.
The build system will create a placeholder for every English article for which there is no corresponding article in that language. 
It will be filled with the `missing` message from above.

#### `lang.css`

This is included if and only if it exists. I'd strongly prefer not to have to
use it. In particular I don't want people to get into arguments about fonts
but basically it's a way to choose the fonts per language. You should set
the variables that are absolutely needed. Example

```css
/* lessons/kr/lang.css */

/* Only comment in overrides as absolutely necessary! */
:root {
  --article-font-family: "best font for korean article text";
  --headline-font-family: "best font for korean headlines";
  /* a block of code */
  /* --code-block-font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; */
  /* a word in a sentence */
  /* --code-font-family: monospace; */
}
```

Notice 2 settings are not changed. It seems unlikely to me that code would
need a different font per language.

PS: While we're here, I love code fonts with ligatures but the seem like a bad
idea for a tutorial site because the ligatures hide the actual characters needed
so please don't ask for or use a ligature code font here.

#### Translation notes

The build process will make a placeholder html file for each article has an english .md file in
`threejs/lessons` but no corresponding .md file for the language. This is to make it easy to include
links in one article that links to another article but that other article has not yet been translated.
This way you don't have to go back and fix already translated articles. Just translate one article
at a time and leave the links as is. They'll link to placeholders until someone translates the missing
articles.

Articles have front matter at the top

```
Title: Localized Title of article
Description: Localized description of article (used in RSS and social media tags)
TOC: Localized text for Table of Contents
```

**DO NOT CHANGE LINKS** : For example a link to a local resources might look like

    [text](link)

or

    <img src="somelink">

While you can add query parameters (see below) do not add "../" to try to make the link relative to the
.md file. Links should stay as though the article exists at the same location as the original English.

### To build

The site is built into the `out` folder

Steps

    git clone https://github.com/gfxfundamentals/threejsfundamentals.git
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

now open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

### Continuous build

You can run `npm run watch` to get continuous building.
Only the article .md files and files that are normally copied are supported.
The table of contents, templates, and index pages are not watched.
